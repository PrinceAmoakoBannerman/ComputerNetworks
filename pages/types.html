    <h2>Types of Computer Networks</h2>
    <p>Computer networks come in various types, each serving different purposes and scales.</p>

    <div class="network-type">
        <h3>Personal Area Network (PAN)</h3>
        <p>PANs are small networks designed for personal use, typically connecting devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets within a short range.</p>

    <div class="network-type">
        <h3>Local Area Network (LAN)</h3>
        <p>LANs are networks that connect computers within a limited area, such as a home, office, or school. They are ideal for sharing resources like printers and files.</p>

    <div class="network-type">
        <h3>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h3>
        <p>MANs cover larger areas than LANs, such as a city or campus. They are used to connect multiple LANs within a region.</p>

    <div class="network-type">
        <h3>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h3>
        <p>WANs are large networks that span across cities, countries, or even continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN.</p>

        <h3>Wireless Networks</h3>
        <p>Wireless networks use radio waves to connect devices without physical cables, enabling mobility and flexibility.</p>
