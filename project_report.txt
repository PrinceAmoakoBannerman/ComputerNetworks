# Project Report: Computers Website

## Introduction
This report presents the Computers Website project, designed to educate users about computers. The website covers the history, types, components, and societal impact of computers. It is structured using HTML and styled with CSS, ensuring clarity and visual appeal.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The homepage of the website.
- `pages/`
  - `history.html`: A page detailing the history of computers.
  - `types.html`: A page describing different types of computers.
  - `components.html`: A page explaining the major components of a computer.
  - `impact.html`: A page discussing the impact of computers on society.
- `css/style.css`: The stylesheet for the website.
- `images/`: A directory containing images used in the website.

## Code Explanation
### HTML Files
#### `index.html`
The homepage introduces the website and provides navigation links to other pages. It includes a welcoming message and an image to enhance visual appeal.

```html
<header>
    <h1>Computers: The Backbone of Modern Technology</h1>
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="pages/history.html">History</a>
        <a href="pages/types.html">Types</a>
        <a href="pages/components.html">Components</a>
        <a href="pages/impact.html">Impact</a>
    </nav>
</header>
```
This code defines the header section with navigation links to other pages.

#### `history.html`
The history page provides a timeline of key milestones in the evolution of computers.

```html
<h3>Key Milestones in Computer History</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1837:</strong> Charles Babbage designs the Analytical Engine.</li>
    <li><strong>1936:</strong> Alan Turing introduces the concept of a universal machine.</li>
    <li><strong>1943-1944:</strong> The Colossus, the first programmable digital computer, is developed.</li>
</ul>
```
This code uses an unordered list to present historical milestones.

#### `types.html`
The types page describes various forms of computers, including desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, and supercomputers.

```html
<div class="component">
    <h3>Desktop Computers</h3>
    <p>Designed for regular use at a single location.</p>
</div>
```
This code defines a section for desktop computers.

#### `components.html`
The components page explains the major parts of a computer, such as the CPU, RAM, hard drive, motherboard, power supply, and input/output devices.

```html
<div class="component">
    <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
    <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer.</p>
    <img src="C:\Users\princ\Desktop\ComputersWebsite\cpu.jpg" alt="CPU" width="300">
</div>
```
This code defines a section for the CPU with an image.

#### `impact.html`
The impact page discusses the positive and negative effects of computers on society.

```html
<h3>Positive Impacts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced communication through emails and social media.</li>
    <li>Improved access to education with online learning platforms.</li>
</ul>
```
This code uses an unordered list to present positive impacts.

### CSS File
The `style.css` file is used to style the website. For example:

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
header {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}
```
This code styles the body and header sections.
