# Project Report: Computer Networks Website

## Introduction
This report presents the Computer Networks Website project, designed to educate users about computer networks. The website covers the history, types, components, and societal impact of computer networks. It is structured using HTML and styled with CSS, ensuring clarity and visual appeal.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The homepage of the website.
- `pages/`
  - `history.html`: A page detailing the history of computer networks.
  - `types.html`: A page describing different types of computer networks.
  - `components.html`: A page explaining the major components of computer networks.
  - `impact.html`: A page discussing the impact of computer networks on society.
- `css/style.css`: The stylesheet for the website.
- `images/`: A directory containing images used in the website.

## Code Explanation
### HTML Files
#### `index.html`
The homepage introduces the website and provides navigation links to other pages. It includes a welcoming message and an image to enhance visual appeal.

```html
<header>
    <h1>Computer Networks: Connecting the World</h1>
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="pages/history.html">History</a>
        <a href="pages/types.html">Types</a>
        <a href="pages/components.html">Components</a>
        <a href="pages/impact.html">Impact</a>
    </nav>
</header>
```
This code defines the header section with navigation links to other pages.

#### `history.html`
The history page provides a timeline of key milestones in the evolution of computer networks.

```html
<h3>Key Milestones in Computer Network History</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1960s:</strong> The concept of packet switching is introduced, laying the foundation for modern networking.</li>
    <li><strong>1969:</strong> ARPANET, the precursor to the internet, is established, connecting four universities in the US.</li>
    <li><strong>1983:</strong> The TCP/IP protocol becomes the standard for ARPANET, enabling interoperability between networks.</li>
</ul>
```
This code uses an unordered list to present historical milestones.

#### `types.html`
The types page describes various forms of computer networks, including PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN, and wireless networks.

```html
<div class="network-type">
    <h3>Local Area Network (LAN)</h3>
    <p>LANs are networks that connect computers within a limited area, such as a home, office, or school.</p>
    <img src="../lan.jpg" alt="Local Area Network" width="300">
</div>
```
This code defines a section for LANs with an image.

#### `components.html`
The components page explains the major parts of computer networks, such as routers, switches, NICs, access points, and cables.

```html
<div class="component">
    <h3>Router</h3>
    <p>A router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks, enabling communication and connectivity.</p>
    <img src="../router.jpg" alt="Router" width="300">
</div>
```
This code defines a section for routers with an image.

#### `impact.html`
The impact page discusses the positive and negative effects of computer networks on society.

```html
<h3>Positive Impacts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Global connectivity enables seamless communication across the globe.</li>
    <li>Access to information provides instant access to vast amounts of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
```
This code uses an unordered list to present positive impacts.

### CSS File
The `style.css` file is used to style the website. For example:

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
header {
    background-color: #1b5e20;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
```
This code styles the body and header sections.

## Features
